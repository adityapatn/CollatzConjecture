From Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture):

The Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1. It concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if a term is even, the next term is one half of it. If a term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence. The conjecture has been shown to hold for all positive integers up to 2.95Ã—10^20, but no general proof has been found.

This project does not aim to solve the Collatz conjecture in any way. I created this project to learn how to use matplotlib and graph the hailstone numbers because they are interesting.
The C++ addition to this project is to speed up the calculation of hailstone numbers and learn C++.
